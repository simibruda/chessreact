Hello there I'have made a chess in react. 
So far, I have managed to make the chess pieces move, I have put an alert each time the king is in check. I have made it so that the king is not allowed to go 
to the squares where it is in check. I still need to work on the rule where a pawn, if it has reached the end of the board, can change [into another piece]. And
on checkmate, and the rule that a piece cannot be moved if the move allows the king to be in check.
I've also deploy it online https://sah.vercel.app/
